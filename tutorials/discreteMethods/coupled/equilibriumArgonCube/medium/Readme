This produces a small coupled canonical NVT ensemble of Argon gas consisting of around 7.5 million atoms.

It couples mdFoamPlus and dsmcFoamPlus together using the Multiscale Universal Interface (MUI) coupling library.

You can run this example in serial (1 process per solver, 2 in total) or in parallel. The default is to use 24 
processes per solver in parallel (48 in total).

This example simulates 1 ns in total, with a time-step of 5 fs, resulting in 200,000 time-steps. 

Note: If you make any changes to the running conditions of one solver then please ensure you also make the appropriate change
in the other.  

WARNING: Generating the initial MD state can take a very long time (30+ minutes) and requires significant amounts of RAM (10GB+)
